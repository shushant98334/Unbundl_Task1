TASK 1  :-


Task 1: Create a Product Carousel for Featured Products
Objective: Develop a responsive and product carousel to showcase featured
products. The carousel should automatically rotate through the featured
products and allow for manual navigation as well.
Requirements: 1. Display a customizable product carousel on the homepage.
2. Enable automatic rotation of featured products, with the option for manual
navigation using arrow buttons.
3. Ensure that the carousel is responsive and visually appealing across various
screen sizes and devices.
4. Provide a brief explanation of your approach, including any tools or
frameworks used, and the reasoning behind your choices.



Explanation of Approach:

1. HTML Structure:

The HTML structure is designed to create a product carousel with slides for each featured product.
The Swiper library is used to implement the carousel functionality.
2. CSS Styling:

CSS is applied to style the carousel, slides, and navigation elements.
Media queries are used to ensure responsiveness across different devices.
3. JavaScript (script.js):

The Swiper library is initialized in the script.js file to enable the carousel functionality.
Configuration options are set to control the behavior of the carousel, including automatic rotation and navigation controls.
4. Swiper Library:

The Swiper library is utilized for its simplicity and effectiveness in creating responsive and touch-friendly carousels.
It provides built-in features for automatic rotation, manual navigation, and pagination.
Reasoning Behind Choices:

HTML and CSS:

The HTML is structured to facilitate easy integration with the Swiper library.
CSS is used for basic styling, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.
Swiper Library:

The Swiper library is chosen for its lightweight nature and ease of use.
It's a popular choice for carousels due to its responsiveness and touch support.
Configuration options allow customization of the carousel's behavior.
JavaScript:

The script.js file is used to initialize the Swiper instance and configure its options.
Custom JavaScript code is minimal as the Swiper library handles most of the carousel functionality.
Overall Design Philosophy:

The approach focuses on simplicity and efficiency.
By leveraging a well-established library like Swiper, development time is reduced, and the resulting carousel is more likely to be robust and bug-free.
The choice of media queries ensures that the carousel adapts to various screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience.
